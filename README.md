## 🔥 WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS STAYS IN THIS APP 🔥

Welcome to the most badass Vegas trip planner ever created. This isn't your grandma's travel app - this is cyberpunk luxury meets Sin City excess, all wrapped in a neon-drenched interface that would make Tony Stark jealous.

## 👾 FEATURES THAT SLAP 👾

- **Epic Countdown Timer** - Know exactly how many seconds until we're popping bottles
- **Real-time Vegas Weather** - So you know whether to pack the mesh or leather
- **Interactive Timeline** - Never miss a reservation or pool party again
- **Traveler Profiles** - Keep track of who's coming and who's tapping out early (weak)
- **3D Vegas Map** - Navigate the Strip like a local, not a tourist
- **Nightlife Mode** - Dark UI for clubs, drink counter, and one-tap emergency "WHERE TF ARE YOU?" button

## 🚀 GETTING THIS PARTY STARTED 🚀

```bash
# Clone this bad boy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vegas-bitch.git

# Get in there
cd vegas-bitch

# Install the essentials
npm install

# Fire it up
npm start
```

## 💸 DEVELOPMENT TOOLS 💸

This app is built with:
- **React + TypeScript** - For that enterprise-grade stability when you're 6 drinks in
- **Framer Motion** - Animations smoother than your best pickup line
- **TailwindCSS** - Styling that flexes harder than the guys at Encore Beach Club
- **Three.js** - 3D effects that will blow your mind (even without substances)

## 🎮 HOW TO USE THIS MASTERPIECE 🎮

1. **Log in** with your assigned degenerate credentials
2. **Sync** your itinerary with the group
3. **Customize** your profile with your party preferences
4. **Share** your location when the squad inevitably gets separated
5. **Track** expenses before they destroy your credit score

## 🏆 WHO MADE THIS? 🏆

The legends who are going to absolutely crush Vegas, that's who.
